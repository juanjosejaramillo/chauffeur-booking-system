### Settings Priority
1. Filament admin panel settings (highest priority)

3. Environment variables (.env)
4. Config files (lowest priority)

### Stripe Key Management Flow
1. Admin sets Stripe mode (test/live) in Filament settings
2. Backend `SettingsController` fetches appropriate key based on mode
3. Frontend requests settings via `/api/settings/public`
4. React components use dynamic key for Stripe initialization

## Legal Document Management
- **Settings API Endpoint**: `/api/settings/public` returns:
  ```json
  {
    "legal": {
      "terms_url": "https://luxridesuv.com/terms",
      "cancellation_policy_url": "https://luxridesuv.com/cancellation-policy"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Admin Configuration**: Settings â†’ Legal Settings tab

- **Supported URL Types**: Website pages, Google Docs, PDF files, any valid URL

## API Authentication
- Sanctum for API authentication
- Token-based authentication for mobile apps (future)
- Guest booking support (no auth required)
- Admin routes protected by Filament auth

## Development Workflow

### Local Setup
```bash
# Backend
cd taxibook-api
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan serve

# Frontend

- **Solution**: 
  - Removed manual event triggers from EditBooking.php
  - Let BookingObserver handle all cancellation events automatically
  - Now stores cancellation_reason in database before status update

- **Cache Management**:

  - Prevents confusion and maintains single source of truth

### PDF Generation System
- **PDF Attachments in Emails**:
  - Controlled via admin panel toggles per email template
  - Two types: Receipt PDF and Booking Details PDF
  - Generated on-demand when emails are sent
  - Stored temporarily in `storage/app/temp/`
  - Automatic cleanup after sending

- **PDF Generation Flow**:
  1. Email template checks `attach_receipt` or `attach_booking_details` flags
  2. NotificationService generates PDFs if enabled
  3. PDFs attached to email using Laravel's attachment system
  4. Temporary files cleaned up after sending

### Production Deployment Notes
